## Frontend:

### 🔖 ReactJS

>A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.Build encapsulated          components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich     data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without         rewriting existing code.React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
  
### 🔖 React Router

>REACT ROUTER,Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model. React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively     with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is      rendering--so take your pick!
